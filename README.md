- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Bedirhan
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in machine learning, finance and project management.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java and Python.

I want to talk about myself a little bit in this text, which I want to have as a preliminary article.
First, although my future plans have been the same for a long time, my academic life, myself 
a narrow look as I can shape certain awareness in the direction I want after adding it
from a point of view, I had the opportunity to look at things from a slightly broader, different perspective.
I can tell you. A multifaceted person whose time in question goes beyond my goals
I think I made. Besides providing the necessary infrastructure for my career in education,
especially with the influence of my interaction with three different departments, working life and becoming an engineer
I can feel it in your culture.

As I perform my profession, which I am very eager to see in my business life in the future
I can be a practical solution-oriented person when doing interdisciplinary thinking
I've been thinking. Changes in thought making that occur with my academic life and age
besides the knowledge he provided me, he also conveyed a great philosophy of life
I can tell you. From programming to economics, from economics to philosophy, from philosophy to communication techniques
I am a computer engineer who is as involved with the culture of self-improvement as I am in my future experience
I'm aiming for a more productive, successful, difference-making career with guidance.
